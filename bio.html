            <p>
                I grew up in a small town just outside of Boston, MA. I went to highschool with the same kids that I went to kindergarten with and lived a fairly sheltered life. I was an active member of my town's Boy Scout troup and became an Eagle Scout my Junior Year
                of High School. I was also an active participant in Concert and Jazz band, playing the trumpet and piano. I helped start a FIRST Robotics team at my school during my Senior year of highscool. After graduation I began my freshman year at
                Tufts to pursue a degree in Computer Science.
